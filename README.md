# configuringVScode
A small step: abandon code::blocks and explore vscode.

## why VScode?
 - light weight.
 - pretty.
 - rich plug-in environment.
 - learn about using .json to configure my own settings.
 - use github accounts to save my personalized setting any time.
 
 ## what have been done?
 - configure settings.json.
 - set some user snippets.
 - set launch.json and tasks.json to build .cpp.
 - understand how a .cpp transfer to a .exe.
 - try to debug using debug tools.
 - Hello world using VScode!
 - take some pratical plug in tools.
 
 ## note: shortcut keys.
 - ctrl shift P: search and command.
 - ctrl K + ctrl R: reference of shortcuts.
 - useful (set by my own): ctrl alt numpad0 :Run this code without debugging.
